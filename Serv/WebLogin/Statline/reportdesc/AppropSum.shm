			This report 
            summarizes the total number of hospital referrals made (by hospital) 
            and separates these referrals into those appropriate for organ, 
            tissue and eye donation. The accuracy of this report depends on the 
            data provided to Statline by the client. For example, if the client 
            only gives Statline &ldquo;Cancer&rdquo; as a rule-out for tissue, 
            then Sepsis, HIV, Hepatitis, etc. will show up as eligible for 
            tissue. The more medical screening that Statline does translates 
            directly into the accuracy of this report. Certain clients which 
            allow Statline to do Advanced Medical Screening use this report 
            instead of doing medical record review in the hospitals to gauge 
            donor potential.</td>
