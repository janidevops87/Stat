    91-120 and > 120 seconds). The first section, All Incoming Calls, shows the distribution for all calls coming 
    into Statline excluding calls in response to a page. This section is intended to show how long a non-coordinator 
    caller (e.g. referral, message) would expect to hold before an agent is available. The second section, Regional 
    Incoming Calls, details the distribution for all calls coming into Statline (excluding calls in response to a 
    page) specifically on your referral and/or message phone lines.  The last section, Page Response, shows the 
    distribution for all calls related to page responses. This section is intended to show how long a coordinator 
    responding to a page would expect to hold before an agent is available.<p><b>
