    </center></div><p>The Approach/Consent summary report is a summary of the approach methods
    and consent outcomes. The report is divided into three sections. The approach methods are
    located on the left side of the report. The consent percentages are located on the right
    side of the report. The columns from left to right are Approach Methods, Referrals, and
    Consent Percentages. The consent percentages are broken down into specific types (Organs,
    Bone, Tissue, Skin, Valves, Eyes).</p>
    <i><p><strong>Section #1</strong> - </i>The first section lists the total number of
    referrals. From the total number of referrals the report continues to breakdown the
    different approach methods. The first category is the total number of Rule-Out referrals.
    These are the referrals that Statline ruled out according to the criteria we received from
    you. The report continues to give you the total number of approached referrals. The
    approached referrals are broken down into two categories, Pre-Referral and Post-Referrals.
    If the family was approached about donation options <i>before</i> calling Statline for the
    appropriate options, the approach will be labeled Pre-Referral. If the family was
    approached about donation options <i>after</i> calling Statline for the appropriate
    options, the approach will be labeled Post- Referral. The total number of Pre-Referral
    calls is listed with the consent percentages to the right for all options. The sub
    categories of Pre-Referral are Family Initiated(the family initiated discussion of
    donation) and Facility Initiated (referring facility initiated the discussion of
    donation). The total numbers of referrals and the consent percentages for these methods
    will be listed to the right for all options. The total number of Post Referral calls is
    listed next with the consent percentages following to the right. The first section ends
    with the number of Unapproachable and Unknown Approaches.</p>
    <i><p><strong>Section #2</strong> - </i>The second section of the report lists three
    methods of approach, Coupled, Decoupled, and Family Initiated. A coupled approach is
    defined as a discussion of death and offering the option of donation at the same time and
    if the family has not come to terms with the death. A decoupled approach is defined as a
    discussion of death separate from a discussion of donation options and the family has come
    to terms with the death. The total number of referrals will be listed for each type of
    approach method and followed with the consent percentages to the right.</p>
    <i><p><strong>Section #3</strong> - </i>The third section of the report combines the
    approach methods in the first two sections. The five categories for approach methods in
    this section are: Pre-Referral, Coupled; Pre-Referral, Decoupled; Post Referral, Coupled;
    Post Referral, Decoupled; Family Initiated.</font></td>
