        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">June 22, 1998</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Client,</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As most of you know, the
        final HCFA rule specific to routine death reporting was
        published in today's Federal Register (Vol. 63, No. 119).
        According to the Summary, these regulations are effective
        August 21st of this year. If you haven't seen the rule
        yet, some of the major points are summarized in the
        following section:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Perhaps the most
        significant item in the final rule makes it mandatory for
        all hospitals to report all deaths, limiting the OPO,
        tissue and eye banks from establishing guidelines (e.g.
        &quot;Call in all deaths under 75 who aren't HIV
        positive&quot;) for the hospitals in their service areas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Hospitals must now
        establish Agreements with the OPO as well as the tissue
        and eye bank(s) that provide recovery services to them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">3. OPO, tissue and eye
        banks must work together to establish donor screening
        criteria, provide education to the hospitals and review
        death records to identify potential donors.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Statline would like to
        plan in advance for the anticipated increase in referral
        volumes attributed to these regulations. Through our
        current referral experience, we have developed a referral
        prediction calculator that can help you understand what
        your referral volumes will become. Please contact us soon
        so that we may share this information with you and help
        both of us plan effectively for the increased call
        volumes. Currently, we anticipate the need to hire and
        train additional staff, but we need your comments to help
        us be as proactive as possible. We would very much
        appreciate continual feedback about your region's
        anticipated plans well before the August, 21st date. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you haven't yet seen a
        copy of the final rule, please give us a call. We'd be
        happy to get one to you. Or, follow this link to the
