    size="3"><p>The Message Detail report is an explanation of the message received word for
    word. Each message is labeled as a General Message, Recipient Listing or Status Change, or
    Request For Information (see descriptions above).</p>
    <p>The top left corner of each message indicates who the message is for, the caller name
    and organization, and the phone number of the caller. The top right corner of the message
    indicates the Statline referral number, call date/time, and the Statline Triage
    Coordinator who took the message. The Message Detail report continues and actually
    documents the message given to the Statline Triage Coordinator. The message continues and
    is followed by an event log. The event log tells the process of the message documentation.
    The event log lists the events that occurred in taking a particular message. The first
    event of any call will be an <i>incoming call. </i>The name of the organization and the
    caller will be documented with a description of the event.</p>
    <p>Other events that may occur during a message are the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><strong>Outgoing Call</strong></em> &#150; The Statline Triage Coordinator will
      place an outgoing call to <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">the appropriate person.</font></p>
      <p><em><strong>Page Pending</strong></em> &#150; The Statline Triage Coordinator pages the
      appropriate person <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">to relay the message.</font></p>
      <p><strong><em>Page Response</em></strong> &#150; The Statline Triage Coordinator receives
      a response from <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">the page pending event.</font></p>
      <p><em><strong>No Page Response</strong></em> &#150; The Statline Triage Coordinator
      documents that a <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">response from the page pending
      event has not occurred. </font></p>
