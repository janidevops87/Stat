<p>To our valued customers:</p>

<p>As you are probably aware by this point, our phone carrier, MCI/Worldcom experienced a
major outage of their toll free lines today. This outage affected most of the United
States and parts of Canada. At this time, I have yet to be informed of the specific cause
of the outage, but as that information becomes available to me, I will relay that
information on to you. I wanted to take this opportunity to let you know how we addressed
the situation, and what steps we are taking to avoid a problem like this in the future.</p>

<p>Let me begin by emphasizing that a problem like this is a <i>major</i> concern to us.
Not only because it halts our ability to provide service to you, but also because of the
huge impact upon potential recipients and the hospitals that you so diligently serve. We
regard everyone in Statline&#146;s communication loop as clients of ours even if they are
actually your direct clients. It is this devotion to our partnership with you that I
believe sets Statline apart from any other service provider you may deal with.</p>

<p>With regards to the situation at hand, we were informed of the problem approximately 15
minutes after the system went down. This was through the help of our clients, and
simultaneous contacts by our service provider. We immediately requested our service
provider to begin switching our lines to a different long distance network so that the
service interruption would be minimal. This process was supposed to take no more then
15-30 minutes. Unfortunately, the process was delayed while the depth and scope of the
outage was being investigated. The switch we requested was for all of the toll free
numbers to be moved off of Worldcom&#146;s network and on to MCI&#146;s network. MCI was
not experiencing any phone outages and appeared to be a more stable platform to put the
numbers on. A switch like this is rare for a phone company to do, and it took them a while
to gather all of the data to input the phone numbers into the MCI database. A greater
frustration was that I personally had a conference call with the Director of Operations
for MCI/Worldcom&#146;s trouble center just last week. During that conversation, I was
promised that a proactive emergency relief plan would be put together specifically for
Statline, and that we should never experience a delay in a switching process. Obviously
this did not occur, and due to this I will be meeting with Chris Jaynes to explore new
providers who can better serve everyone&#146;s needs. In the meantime, I have requested
that all toll free numbers remain on the MCI network until we can come to a permanent
resolution with our phone service provider. I will also be requesting a letter from
Worldcom that details the incident. Once received, I will forward that letter on to you
for your files, and to share with the facilities that you serve.</p>

<p>Once again, I want to express my deep concern, and assure each of you that Statline
will continue to search for the best possible outcome to this situation. I also want to
thank each of you for your understanding and continued support of Statline. Through our
partnership, I will do everything in my power to ensure that you have the most reliable
phone system possible. The strength of our client base and the nature of our business
allows Statline to have considerable pull in the telecommunications industry and I will
use this power to get the best possible resolution to this dilemma. If you have any
further questions, please feel free to contact me or your Client Services Manager at
888-881-7828.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
