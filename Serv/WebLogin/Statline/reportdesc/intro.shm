    reports that are available to our Statline customers. The notebook is divided into several
    sections. The sections are Internet Access, Standard Reports, Statistical Reports, Medical
    Abbreviations, and Glossary.</p>
    <p>Each sample report will have a written description of what you will find on the report
    and how to read the report. All of the reports may be run for a specific time period and
    organization. You choose the parameters that will meet your need. To receive the best
    value for the service we offer, take some time to understand the reports you will be
    receiving. The information available is valuable to your organization and hospital
    development efforts.</p>
    <p>Since Statline is a <i>Communications Center</i>, we are capable of offering you much
    more than an answering service ever could. Statline offers a standard set of reports which
    are based on the information that we gather at each level of service. Several statistical
    reports are available to you as well. Additional reports can be customized and run to your
    specifications. Statline can create reports that compare information instead of just
    regurgitating the raw data.</p>
    <p>The standard set of reports are offered to you at no extra cost to your service
    package. The statistical reports are also available to you at no cost to your service
    package. The statistical reports are available to you at no cost through Internet access
    as well as the standard set of reports. For custom reports, there will be a one time
    development fee of $50.00 per hour. Most reports take 5-10 hours to develop (more
    complicated reports could take longer, however). Once developed, there is no additional
    charge for running the report or sending it to you.</p>
    <p>If at any time you have questions, comments or concerns, please contact the Business
    and Accounts Manager, Ian Barber toll free at #1-888-881-7828. Once again, we are
    happy to be serving your organization and would like to welcome you to Statline.</font></td>
