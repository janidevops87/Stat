			This report is a summary (by hospital) of the individuals who’ve approached families for donation 
			over the date range selected by the report user.  Names are separated by Designated Requestor (DR) vs. Non- DR (DR is a feature any Statline client using consent tracking services has access to- to activate it, the client must send a list of hospital staff that are considered DR’s so that Statline can enter them into the referral database).
			<p>
			Additionally, a summary of each hospital caller (by hospital) who makes a referral is included with this report.  The total number of deaths referred by each person is summarized here.
