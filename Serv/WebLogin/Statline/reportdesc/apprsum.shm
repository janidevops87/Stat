The report identifies the number of approaches attempted by individual names and how many of the referrals were appropriate for organ, tissue and eye donation.
    <!--The Approach Person Summary report is a summary of the referrals by
    facility listing the names of the people who have approached for donation. The report
    indicates the total number of referrals by approach person and how many were Appropriate
    (based on specific region criteria), Approached, Consented, and Recovered. The total
    number of unapproached referrals will be listed for the referral facility as well. The
    report can be printed to give actual numbers or percentages (see report).</p>
	<p>The column headings from left to right are Referral Facility/Approach Person, # of
    Total Referrals (the number of referral calls that Statline took), Appropriate (donation
    options that are appropriate according to the criteria received from the recovery agency),
    Approach (specific options that were approached for donation), Consent (specific options
    that the next of kin consented to for donation), and Recovery (specific options that were
    recovered for transplant or research). The Appropriate, Approach, Consent, and Recovery
    categories are broken down into sub-categories by specific types (O for organ, B for bone,
    ST for soft tissue, SK for skin, HV for heart valves, and E for eyes).</p>
    <p>The number of unapproached referrals will be listed first. The appropriate options for
    unapproached referrals will follow to the right of the total number of unapproached
    referrals. For each approach person, the total number of referrals called into Statline is
    listed. Out of the total number of referral calls, the report will continue across and
    identify what specific options were appropriate, approached, consented, and recovered.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of the report, the columns will be totaled. The total number of referrals
    will be listed as well as the total number of referrals for the appropriate, approach,
    consent, and recovery columns by specific type. </font> --></td>
