    </center></div></i><p>The Referral Summary-Condensed report is just as it states, a
    condensed version of the Referral Summary report. This report reviews the four steps
    involved in the referral process (identifying if the referral is appropriate and
    approached, consented, and recovered ). This report will calculate the total number of
    referrals for a specific hospital, region and/or time period at the bottom of the report.
    The total number of donors by specific type (organ, bone, tissue, skin, valves, eyes) will
    be calculated at the bottom of the report.</p>
    <p>Reading from left to right, each referral is listed by date followed by the person who
    called into the communications center, the unit, the potential donor&#146;s name, sex, age
    and the appropriate/approach, consent, recovered categories by specific type (organ, bone,
    tissue, skin, valves, eyes). <i><b>Please note that the appropriate/approach column will
    give you information for only the appropriate referrals that were approached for donation.</b></i>
    </p>
    <p>In regions where the recovery agency performs all approaches and the communications
    center pre-screens the referrals for limited rule-outs, a referral may be ruled out for
    donation after the recovery agency conducts further screening. For example, if a referral
    is not ruled-out for donation upon the initial referral call, however, upon further
    investigation by the recovery agency the potential donor is ruled out, the
    appropriate/approach column will indicate that the referral is appropriate for donation. </p>
    <p>This report will assist in hospital development efforts to identify consent and
    recovery rates for appropriate approached referrals. This report is helpful in assisting
    hospitals in their Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) or Performance Improvement (PI)
    programs by providing them with a complete donor referral and recovery report to compare
    to their death log. </font></td>
