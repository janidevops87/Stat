    sections, Male and Female. The Male portion is on the top half of the report and the
    Female portion is located on the bottom half of the report. The report can be printed to
    give numbers or percentages (see examples).</p>
    <p>Each section has four columns labeled Male or Female, # of Total Referrals (the number
    of referral calls that Statline took), Appropriate (donation options that are appropriate
    according to the criteria received from the recovery agency), Approach (specific options
    that were approached for donation), Consent (specific options that the next of kin
    consented to for donation), and Recovery (specific options that were recovered for
    transplant or research). Once again the Appropriate, Approach, Consent and Recovery
    columns are subdivided into specific option types (O for organs, B for bone, ST for soft
    tissue, SK for skin, HV for heart valves, and E for eyes).</p>
    <p>The race is listed under the Male or Female column (ex: Caucasian, Hispanic, Native
    American). The second column is the total number of referrals for the specific race. The
    report continues to guide you through the number of appropriate, approached, consented and
    recovered referrals for each race category. At the bottom of each section, the columns are
    totaled.</font>--></td>
