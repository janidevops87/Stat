    <p>The process to retrieve your referral data reports is quite simple. The user must first
    go to the Statline home page on the Internet. To get to Statline&#146;s home page, the
    user must type in www.statline.com in the address section located at the top of the screen
    after logging on to the Internet. Press enter after typing in www.statline.com.
    Statline&#146;s web site will appear. You will notice that a table of contents is located
    on the left side of the screen. The scroll bar to the right of the contents section will
    allow you to scroll down to the bottom of the section. You will find the word Login. Click
    on Login and you will be connected to the login screen.</p>
    <p>To proceed, you must contact Statline for a user ID and password. Once a user ID and
    password has been assigned, you may continue by typing in your user ID, password, and then
    clicking on the shaded login box. You will now be connected to the Select Report
    Parameters screen. If you would like to change your password at anytime, please contact
    Statline.</p>
    <p>The Select Report Parameters screen allows the user to choose the specific type of
    report, the date range, report group, organization and type (referral type:
    Organ/Tissue/Eye, Tissue/Eye, Eye only or Rule-out). Click the arrow to the right of the
    report box and you will be able to choose the specific report you wish to retrieve. To
    choose a report, guide the mouse to the highlighted report you wish and click once. Once a
    report has been selected, the next step is to choose the date range for the report. Enter
    the date and time range. The report group must be selected next. Report groups are
    categorized as either messages/imports or referrals. Report groups are designed to reflect
    a particular group of hospitals (ex: Healthone hospitals) or the report group for
    referrals can include all referrals for a specific region. A report group can also be
    designed for a hospital development coordinator to reflect the hospitals assigned to the
    coordinator. Once a report group has been selected, the next section is organization. The
    user has the ability to choose a specific organization (referring facility) or leave blank
    to reflect all organizations. The last selection is the type. This section only pertains
    to referral data. The four types of referrals are Organ/Tissue/Eye, Tissue/Eye, Eye only
    and Rule-out. The user may choose a specific type when reviewing a referral or leave this
    section blank to reflect all types.</p>
    <p>Once all of the report parameters have been selected, press show to display the report.
    To print the report, make sure all margins are at .25. Click on the printer at the top of
    the page to print the report. To start the report selection process again, click on the x
    box in the upper right hand corner to return to the Select Report Parameters screen. </font></td>
