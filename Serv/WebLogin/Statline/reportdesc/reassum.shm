    the top of the report the totals of the appropriate and rule-out referrals are listed to
    obtain the total number of referrals. The remaining report is broken down into four main
    sections, Appropriate, Approach, Consent, and Recovery. <b>Please keep in mind that to
    receive complete information for this report, Statline needs to track consent and recovery
    information if this triage service level has been purchased. The interactive medical
    rule-out service is also required to produce this report.</b></p>
    <p>The <i>Appropriate </i>section will list the number of appropriate referrals by type (<i>organs,
    bone, tissue, skin, valves and eyes).</i> Appropriate referrals are defined as donor
    referrals that are appropriate for potential donation according to the information
    received by the hospital (age, past medical history etc.). The percentage is indicated to
    the left of every number. This section will also provide the number of <i>Not Appropriate</i>
    referrals by type <i>(organs, bone, tissue, skin, valves and eyes).</i> Once again, the
    percentage is indicated to the left of every number. If a referral was not appropriate for
    a specific type of donation <i>(organs, bone, tissue, skin, valves and eyes), </i>the
    different reason categories are listed under the Not Appropriate category. The reasons for
    a not appropriate referral are Age, High Risk, Medical Rule-out, Not Appropriate or
    Previous Vent. The numbers as well as the percentages are tracked for organs, bone,
    tissue, skin, valves and eyes.</p>
    <p>If a referral was appropriate for a specific option, the report will lead you down to
    the next section, <i>Approach.</i> This section will give you combined approach
    information on appropriate referrals. The number of approached referrals will be listed by
    type (<i>organs, bone, tissue, skin, valves and eyes)</i> and the percentages will be to
    the left of the number. If a referral was not approached, the reasons are listed under Not
    Approached. The reasons why a referral was not approached are as follows: Unknown, Family
    Unavailable, Coroner Deny, Medical Rule-out, Time/Logistics, High Risk, Unapproachable,
    Arrest and Never Brain Dead. The number of Not Approached referrals are listed as well as
    the percentages.</p>
    <p>If a referral was appropriate and approached, the report will lead you down to the next
    section, <i>Consent.</i> This section will give you the number of consented referrals by
    type <i>(organs, bone, tissue, skin, valves and eyes).</i> If consent was not obtained on
    a donor referral, the reasons are listed under Not Consented. The different reasons for
    not consented are Ethnic, Religious, Emotional, Unknown and Previous Discussion. The
    number as well as the percentage is tracked by type.</p>
    <p>If consent was obtained on a donor referral, the report will lead you down to the last
    section, <i>Recovery.</i> This section will give you the number and percentage of
    recovered options by type<i> (organs, bone, tissue, skin, valves and eyes).</i> If a
    consented referral was not recovered, the report will indicate the reason under Not
    Recovered. The different reasons for not recovered are as follows: Coroner Deny, Medical
    Rule-out, High Risk, Time/Logistics, Arrest, Never Brain Dead, Heart Transplantable and
    Unknown. The number as well as the percentage is tracked by type.-->
    The Reason Summary is a condensed statistical report of referral data. At the top of the 
    report the totals of the appropriate and rule-out referrals are listed to obtain the total 
    number of referrals. The remaining report is broken down into four main sections, Appropriate, 
    Approach, Consent, and Recovery. Again, for a client to receive complete information from this 
    report, Statline needs to track consent and recovery information (additional service charges applied).
