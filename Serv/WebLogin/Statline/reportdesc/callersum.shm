    <!--The Caller Person Summary report is a summary of the individuals who
    have called referrals into the communication center. The report identifies the number of
    referral calls by individual names and how many of the referrals were Appropriate,
    Approached, Consented and Recovered. The report can be printed to give numbers or
    percentages (see examples).</p>
    <p>The column headings from left to right are Referral Facility/Caller person, # of Total
    Referrals (the number of referral calls that Statline took), Appropriate (donation options
    that are appropriate according to the criteria received from the recovery agency),
    Approach (specific options that were approached for donation), Consent (specific options
    that the next of kin consented to for donation), and Recovery (specific options that were
    recovered for transplant or research). The Appropriate, Approach, Consent and Recovery
    categories are broken down into sub categories by specific types (O for organ, B for bone,
    ST for soft tissue, SK for skin, HV for heart valves and E for eyes).</p>
    <p>The total number of referral calls for the specific hospital will be listed first
    followed to the right with the number of appropriate, approach, consent and recovery
    information. For each caller person, the total number of referrals will be listed first
    followed to the right with what specific options were appropriate, approached, consented
    and recovered.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of the report, the columns will be totaled. The total number of referrals
    will be listed followed by the total number of referrals for the appropriate, approach,
    consent and recovery columns by specific type.--></font></td>
