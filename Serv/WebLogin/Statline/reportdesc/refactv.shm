    </center></div><p>All potential organ donors are tracked as potential tissue and eye
    donors at Statline since we immediately contact the organ procurement coordinator and do
    not perform in depth screening for tissue and eye eligibility. The second category, <i>tissue/eye</i>,
    is labeled as such because essentially every potential tissue donor is also a potential
    eye donor. The <i>eyes only</i> category is when both organ and tissue donation is not an
    option. Generally, the only option left is eyes. The <i>Rule-out referrals</i> are
    referrals that we pre-screen for recovery agencies that are medically ruled out for
    donation according to the criteria given to Statline by the agencies. </p>
    <p>A section for each call type follows the report. The calls are listed by referral
    number, date and time. Each referral call listed indicates what hospital the call came
    from, the patient name and the status of the referral. To receive more information
    regarding a particular referral, you must refer to the Referral Detail report.</font></td>
