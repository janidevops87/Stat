    </table>
    </center></div><p>The age categories are listed in increments of 5 years up to the age of
    20 years old. Since donor size is more important in pediatric patients, five year age
    increments will allow you to take a closer look at the age demographics for pediatric
    donor referrals. Above the age of 20 years old, the age categories are in ten year
    increments.</p><!--
    <p>The columns for each section from left to right are Male (or Female), # of Total
    Referrals (the number of referral calls that Statline took), Appropriate (donation options
    that are appropriate according to the criteria received from the recovery agency),
    Approach (specific options that were approached for donation), Consent (specific options
    that the next of kin consented to for donation), and Recovery (specific options that were
    recovered for transplant or research). </p>
    <p>For each age category, the total number of referrals and how many were Appropriate,
    Approached, Consented, and Recovered will be documented. The Appropriate, Approach,
    Consent and Recovery columns are subdivided into specific option types (O for organ, B for
    bone, ST for soft tissue, SK for skin, HV for heart valve and E for eyes).</p>
    <p>At the bottom of each section, the columns are totaled. Below the totals, the average
    age for each column will be documented. With this report, you can identify the average age
    of appropriate, approached, consented and recovered donor referrals by specific type
    (organ, bone, soft tissue, skin, heart valve and eyes).</font></td>-->
