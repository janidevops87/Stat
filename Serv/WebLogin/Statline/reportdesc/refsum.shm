    </center></div><p>The Referral Summary Report is a condensed list of Referral Detail
    reports. Referral Detail reports are summarized for a specific hospital and/or time
    period. The report summarizes referral information and the appropriate, approach, consent
    and recovery data. If one of these categories is not appropriate, not approached, not
    consented or not recovered, the reason will be documented.</p>
    <p>The report summarizes the referrals into four different referral type categories:</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="5%" valign="top">1.</td>

        <td width="50%">Rule-Out Referrals<font face="Times New Roman"><font
        face="Times New Roman"></font></font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div><p>All potential organ donors are tracked as potential tissue and eye
    donors at Statline since we immediately contact the organ procurement coordinator and do
    not perform in depth screening for the tissue and eye eligibility. The second category, <i>tissue/eye</i>,
    is labeled as such because essentially every potential tissue donor is also a potential
    eye donor. The <i>eyes only</i> category is when both organ and tissue donation is not an
    option. Generally, the only option left is eyes. The <i>Rule-out referrals </i>are
    referrals that we pre-screen for recovery agencies that are medically ruled out for
    donation according to the criteria given to Statline by the agencies.</p>
    <p>Within these categories, the referrals are listed by hospital alphabetically followed
    by date and time of the referral. Each referral is summarized with the following
    information: referral date/time, Statline referral #, referring hospital, referring unit,
    referring person, approach person, medical record #, patient name, gender, age, race,
    cause of death, and date/time of death. To the right of this information, the appropriate,
    approach, consented, and recovered categories are summarized by specific type (organ,
    bone, tissue, skin, valves, eyes).</p>
    <p>The legend at the bottom of the report provides a guideline to the information
    contained in each referral summary.</font></td>
