This report details the range of time in which the hospital reports the referral.  
The time the call is received in the communications center is compared to the 
reported time of death.  These are the time ranges:  
<p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>0 – 1 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>1 – 3 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>3 – 6 hours</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This report will be helpful in determining if hospitals are reporting in a timely manner.  In addition to the total number of referrals, this report also identifies the number of appropriate option types per time range.
