    <td><strong><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>REFERRAL DETAIL</b></font></strong><font
    face="Times New Roman" size="3"><p>The Referral Detail Report is an explanation of the
    donor referral call. The report is divided into five sections, <i>Caller Information,
    Patient Information, Approach Information, Options <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font
    face="Times New Roman" size="3">and Event Log Information. </i>Each Referral Detail Report
    will indicate the Statline referral call number, call date/time, referral type, the
    Statline Triage Coordinator and the status of the referral.</font></font></p>
    <p>The Referral Detail Report documents the actual phone call. <b>The information obtained
    during the referral call depends on the service level that was chosen to meet your
    organization&#146;s needs.</b><u><i></p>
    <p></i><strong>Caller Information</u></strong><br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The caller&#146;s first and last name, title and
    sub-location (ex: ER, SICU, OR) will be documented. The organization and phone number
    (with area code) is documented in this section as well.</font></p>
    <u><i><p></i><strong>Patient Information</u></strong><br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This section documents the patient demographic
    information. The information is straight forward and documents the patient name, admit
    date to the hospital, gender, age, weight, race, medical record number, ventilator status,
    declaration of death including date and cause of death, case history and past medical
    history (if known at the time of the call). If specific questions were customized for the
    region, positive answers will be documented in the medical information section. </font></p>
    <u><i><p></i><strong>Approach Information</u></strong><br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If Statline tracks approach information, this is the
    section that will document the information received from the caller. This section will
    indicate if an approach was done. If an approach was done, the name of who approached the
    family will be documented. Two different types of approaches will be documented. If the
    family was approached about donation options <i>before</i> calling Statline for the
    appropriate options, the approach will be labeled Pre-Referral. If the family was
    approached about donation options <i>after</i> calling Statline for the appropriate
    options, the approach will be labeled Post- Referral. The approach will also be described
    as either a coupled or a decoupled approach. A coupled approach is defined as a discussion
    of death and offering the option of donation at the same time and if the family has not
    come to terms with the death. A decoupled approach is defined as a discussion of death
    separate from a discussion of donation options and the family has come to terms with the
    death. The coupled and decoupled approaches will be documented with the Pre and Post
    Referral status.</font></p>
    <p>The next of kin, relationship and phone number will be documented in this section if
    this information is available from the caller.</p>
    <u><i><p></i><strong>Options</u></strong><br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This section will track what donation options are
    appropriate according to the criteria (age and medical) the customer defines. Approach
    information will be tracked for each donation option. Consent and recovery information is
    tracked in this section for each appropriate donation option. The reasons why options were
    not appropriate, not approached, not consented, and not recovered are listed below:</font></p>

    </i><strong>Event Log Information</u></strong><br>
    Every Referral Detail report will contain an event log at the bottom of the page. This
    section tells the story of the referral. For each event type, the date/time, event type,
    organization, to/from, and a description will be documented if applicable. Events that may
    occur during a referral call are the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong><em>Incoming Call</em></strong> - This event is automatically noted on every
      incoming call into the communications center.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Note</em></strong> - This is a brief note if any additional explanation is 
      needed about the referral.  It is also used to describe a floor location if that floor/unit 
      is not included in Statline’s standardized list..</p>
      <p><em><strong>Outgoing Call</strong></em> - The Statline Triage Coordinator will place an
      outgoing call to the appropriate person.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Page Pending</em></strong> - The Statline Triage Coordinator pages the
      appropriate person to relay the message.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Page Response</em></strong> - The Statline Triage Coordinator receives a
      response from the page pending event.</p>
      <p><strong><em>No Page Response</em></strong> - The Statline Triage Coordinator documents
      that a response from the page pending event has not occurred.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Consent Pending</strong></em> - The Statline Triage Coordinator creates a
      consent pending once options have been give on an appropriate donor. The creation of this
      event allows the computer to notify the Triage Coordinator after 4 hours to follow up with
      the hospital if the communications center has not received a call back from the hospital
      (this will only happen if the hospital does the approach for donation).</p>
      <p><strong><em>Consent Outcome</em></strong> - The outcome of the approach is documented. </p>
      <p><em><strong>Recovery Pending</strong></em> - If a family has consented to donation, a
      recovery pending is created until the communications center is notified of the recovery by
      the recovery agency.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Recovery Outcome</strong></em> - The recovery agency has notified the
      communications center of the final outcome of the referral for tracking purposes.</p>
