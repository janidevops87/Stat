    face="Times New Roman" size="3"><p>The Import Offer Detail Report is an explanation of the
    import call received. Each import offer call is explained in this report.<br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br>
    The top left corner of each import offer call indicates who the call is for, the caller
    name and organization, and the phone number of the caller. The top right corner of the
    import offer indicates the Statline referral number, call date/time, and the Statline
    Triage Coordinator who received the message. The Import Offer Detail report continues and
    actually documents the offer that is being given to the organization. An event log follows
    the import offer detail report. The event log tells the story of the import offer. The
    event log lists the events that occurred in taking a particular message. The first event
    of any call will be an <i>incoming call</i>. The name of the organization and the caller
    will be documented with a description of the event. Other events that may occur during an
    import offer call are the following:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong><em>Outgoing Call</em></strong> &#150; The Statline Triage Coordinator will
      place an outgoing call to <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">the appropriate person.</font></p>
      <p><em><strong>Page Pending</strong></em> &#150; The Statline Triage Coordinator pages the
      appropriate person to relay the message.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Page Response</strong></em> &#150; The Statline Triage Coordinator receives
      a response from <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">the page pending event.</font></p>
      <p><em><strong>No Page Response</strong></em> &#150; The Statline Triage Coordinator
      documents that a <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">response from the page pending
      event has not o<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">ccurred. </font></font></font></p>
