    size="3"><p>This report tracks all <i>non- referral</i> related calls. The top of the
    report summarizes the number of calls and is labeled Message Type Summary. There are three
    different types of message calls, General Message, Recipient Listing or Status Change, and
    Request For Information. A <i>general message</i> is a call that comes into the system
    that is not a referral, import offer, recipient listing/status change or request for
    information (ex: an individual calling to leave a message for someone). A <i>recipient
    listing/status change</i> is a call from a transplant center to a recovery agency to list
    a patient or change the status of a waiting recipient (ex: Jane from University Hospital
    called to list a patient for a liver transplant). This message is passed along
    immediately. A <i>request for information</i> message is a call from someone who is
    requesting information (donor cards, literature on donation/transplantation). </p>
    <p>The report continues to be followed by a section for each call type. The calls are
    listed by referral number, date and time. Each message listed indicates whom the call is
    for, who called and the organization they are calling from (if any). To receive more
    information regarding a particular message, you must refer to the Message Detail report.</font></td>
