        DATA</strong></font><p>Selection of this report creates a
        data file containing a list of hospital staff who
        performed a family approach. The primary use of this data
        file is to use the data for a mail merge letter which is
        sent to the hospital staff to thank them for their
        approach efforts if the patient did <em>not</em> become a
        donor. Obviously, this file is only useful if your region
        allows hospital staff to approach families for donation.
        (Additionally, this report is only useful if your region
        collects approach informaiton through Statline.)</p>
        <p>This report is a file of data which is downloaded to
        your computer. When this report is selected, a data file
        is created based on the date, report group, and referral
        type parameters selected. When the file is created, you
        are asked to selected a location on your computer to
        download and save the file. It is this data file which
        may be used to create a mail merge document.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Setting Report Parameters</strong></em></p>
        <p>As well as setting the date and report group
        parameters, it is important to set the referral type
        parameter. It is this parameter which will filter which
        referrals are used. For example, if you are an eye bank,
        you will want to select <em>Eyes Only</em> under the <em>Referral
        Type</em> parameter.</p>
